These embedding vectors are lists of numbers where each number a vector in space. These vector values dont have any real meaning on there own, but relationships between vectors dose have meaning and is important. EX: simmilar words will have simmilar vectors meaning there vectors will we closer together in space and vise versa. How do we know if there far or close? The distance between these vectors can be calculated using cosine similarity or euclidean distance. we dont need to calulate this ourself as there libraries to do that, but linear algebra is important to understand how this works. There are also many types of embedding models ranging from simple to complex. A better model can help capture the meaning of text better so having good embedding for our chunks is important."
